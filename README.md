# SMW-LevelEditor

This is a very VERY Crude SMBW Level Editor for Unity. There are bugs, some shit is broken. Don't blame me.

Made in Unity version 2021.3.1.14f1. Why this version? Because thats the version the game I'm making is in, and what I had installed at the time.

How to use:
- Drop your levels into MarioLevels folder or anywhere in the project.
- In the scene, click on LevelCreator-Base
- On the inspector view, click New Level.
 - If you want to you can also import a level, clear the current one, etc.
- Drop Actor Prefabs into your scene, located in /Prefabs/.
- Modify your ground by clicking on the ground and then click on "Edit Spline"
- Add new ground by dropping in a GroundAsset.
- Once you're done editing, click Export, the asset will be saved to /Assets/Export/
- Enjoy.
