# SMW-LevelEditor

This is a very VERY Crude SMW Level Editor for Unity. There are bugs, some shit is broken. Don't blame me.

How to use:
- Drop your levels into MarioLevels folder or anywhere in the project.
- In the scene Add your Text Asset to the ImportCourses Script located on the YmlToSpriteShape
- Run "Game"
- In the scene view, move actors around.
- Select any of the CloseShapePrefabs, and click "Edit Spline"
- Move spline points around/add new ones. Do whatever.
- Once done, click into the game view, and press "K" on your keyboard. It will export the level to Assets/Exports/
- Import level via Toolbox and be sure to compress
