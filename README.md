# SMW-LevelEditor

This is a very VERY Crude SMW Level Editor for Unity. There are bugs, some shit is broken. Don't blame me.

Made in Unity version 2021.3.1.14f1. Why this version? Because thats the version the game I'm making is in, and what I had installed at the time.

How to use:
- Drop your levels into MarioLevels folder or anywhere in the project.
- In the scene Add your Text Asset to the ImportCourses Script located on the YmlToSpriteShape
- Run "Game"
- In the scene view, move actors around.
- Select any of the CloseShapePrefabs, and click "Edit Spline"
- Move spline points around/add new ones. Do whatever.
- Once done, click into the game view, and press "K" on your keyboard. It will export the level to Assets/Exports/
- Import level via Toolbox and be sure to compress
